<p>Libertarianism is a political philosophy which upholds individual liberty, especially freedom of expression and action. Libertarianism includes diverse beliefs and organizations; all advocate either the minimization or the elimination of the state, and the goal of maximizing individual liberty and freedom.</p>
<p>Libertarian schools of thought differ over the degree to which the state should be reduced, with minarchists advocating reduction to just state protection from aggression, theft, breach of contract, and fraud, and anarchists advocating complete elimination of the state. Additionally, some schools are supportive of private property rights in the ownership of unappropriated land and natural resources while others reject such private individual ownership and often support communal ownership instead. These are often grouped as right-libertarians and left-libertarians respectively. "Right libertarianism" has been described as better known. Despite these categorizations, libertarians typically reject being described as either "left" or "right."</p>
